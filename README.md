## Flow

- Raw Music files on CDS-Carlos server
  - Need to decide on folders to use for analysis and set a definite folder structure

- `clip_extraction.py`
  Extracts clips from the CDS-Carlos server to a local machine. Can be given parameters for length of the clips, number of clips, and position of the clips to extract. Saves the files in wav format in the same folder structure.
